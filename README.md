# Sustainability Tools for Listed Companies

Case Introduction:

Sustainability matters for a multitude of reasons, encompassing environmental,f social, and economic dimensions. By prioritizing sustainability, we can create a more equitable, resilient, and prosperous world of present and future generations. Unfortunately, in the absence of standardization, gathering of accurate and reliable data on sustainability performance of a company across various operations, supply chain complexity, high cost of implementation, constantly changing regulations and standards, and lack of skilled resources are some of the challenges listed companies are facing today to provide meaningful information to investors regarding their progress on sustainability. Thus, it is not surprising that most of the investors mistrust the sustainability information that listed companies disclose and doubt that they will be able to implement their transition plans.

SIX is committed to help their listed companies transition to a more sustainable future. It is important to understand that stock exchanges do not control capital flows â€“ investors decide where to deploy their capital. Nevertheless, stock exchanges can reduce capital-market inefficiencies that can hinder the optimal allocation of economic resources i.e., towards transitioning to a sustainable economy. With the beforementioned objective and scope in mind, SIX aims to bring awareness to their listed companies about various tools (best practices) available in the market to track and report their sustainability progress along the value chain. 

Use Cases for such a solution include: 
* Companies gather insights on best practices on sustainability methodologies, relevant datasets and reporting practices implemented by peers within or beyond their respective industries.
* Investors can leverage specific sustainability tools implemented by companies to evaluate either their carbon footprint or the potential risks posed to their investments. 

## Expected Outcome:

A platform of aggregated and categorized tools for ESG data depending on needs. OR a program able to identify the right tools for each industry.
We expect a mockup version with or without actual data behind.
